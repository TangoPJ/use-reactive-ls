Just for fun, I whipped up a custom React hook that makes localStorage reactive. The reactivity isn't stuck in one component â€” it's global! So whenever localStorage updates, every component using the hook stays in sync. Handy for keeping your app's state consistent across the board.

Oh, and donâ€™t forget to eat your broccoli ðŸ¥¦ â€” itâ€™s good for you!
